## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.13 or later
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation

1.  **Open your NoStressPDF source directory**
    ```bash
    cd nostresspdf
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

4.  **Open your browser**
    Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application running.

### 🐳 Docker

NoStressPDF includes Docker and Docker Compose configuration for local builds. No official NoStressPDF container image is published yet.

#### Build the image locally

```bash
docker build -t nostresspdf .
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name nostresspdf nostresspdf
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access NoStressPDF.

#### Build from source with Docker Compose

If you want to build from source or need to modify the code:

```bash
# Development mode (with hot reload)
docker compose --profile dev up

# Production mode (static build + Nginx)
docker compose --profile prod up --build
```

- Development: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Production: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To stop containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

#### 🌐 Subpath Deployment (basePath Support)

NoStressPDF supports deployment under a subpath (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/nostresspdf/`). To enable this, you must specify the base path during the build process.

**Using Docker Build:**
```bash
docker build --build-arg BASE_PATH=/nostresspdf -t nostresspdf .
```

**Using Docker Compose:**
```yaml
services:
  nostresspdf:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        - BASE_PATH=/nostresspdf
    environment:
      - BASE_PATH=/nostresspdf
```

*Note: Since the app is statically exported, the `BASE_PATH` must be provided during the build stage.*

## 📜 Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with Turbopack. Automatically runs `predev` to decompress LibreOffice WASM files.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production. Automatically runs `postbuild` to decompress WASM files in `out/`.
- `npm run start`: Starts the production server.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code using ESLint.
- `npm run test`: Runs tests using Vitest.

## 🚀 Production Deployment Guide

NoStressPDF is configured for static export (`output: 'export'`), which means it can be deployed to any service that supports static website hosting without requiring a Node.js server.

> 📖 **For comprehensive deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)**

### Quick Start

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   All static files will be generated in the `out` directory.

2. **Deploy to your preferred platform:**
   - **Vercel** (Recommended): `vercel --prod`
   - **Netlify**: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=out`
   - **GitHub Pages**: Push to `main` branch (uses GitHub Actions)
   - **Cloudflare Pages**: `wrangler pages deploy out`
   - **Docker + Nginx**: `docker compose --profile prod up --build`

### Deployment Files Included

| File | Platform |
|------|----------|
| `vercel.json` | Vercel |
| `netlify.toml` | Netlify |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | GitHub Pages |
| `public/_headers` | Cloudflare Pages / Netlify |
| `docker-compose.yml` + `nginx.conf` | Docker / Self-hosted |
| `.htaccess` | Apache |

### Important Notes
- **Headers Configuration**: Security and caching headers are pre-configured in all deployment files.
- **Image Optimization**: Static export uses `images: { unoptimized: true }`.
- **WASM Support**: All deployment configs include proper MIME types for WebAssembly.
- **Subpath Support**: Set `BASE_PATH` environment variable during build to deploy under a subdirectory.

### Verify Deployment
After deployment, please check the following features to ensure everything is working correctly:
- Multi-language routing (e.g., `/en`, `/zh`)
- Tool page loading
- WebAssembly (PDF processing) functionality
