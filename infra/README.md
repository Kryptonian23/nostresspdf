# HushPDF AWS sandbox

The authentication stack creates only the Cognito resources needed to test
browser accounts. It does not receive or process PDF files. After authentication
is verified, the separate [`billing`](billing/README.md) stack adds Stripe
test-mode subscriptions and webhook-managed entitlements.

## Deploy with the AWS console

1. Open **CloudFormation** in the AWS region you want to use.
2. Choose **Create stack**, then **With new resources (standard)**.
3. Upload `infra/cognito-sandbox.yaml`.
4. Name the stack `hushpdf-auth-sandbox`.
5. Enter a globally unique `DomainPrefix`, such as
   `hushpdf-kryptonian23-sandbox`.
6. Keep the localhost callback and logout defaults while developing.
7. Create the stack and wait for `CREATE_COMPLETE`.
8. Copy the three public identifiers from the stack's **Outputs** tab into a
   local `.env.local` file:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=<UserPoolId output>
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=<UserPoolClientId output>
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_DOMAIN=<CognitoDomain output>
NEXT_PUBLIC_BILLING_API_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_REWARDED_ACCESS_ENABLED=false
```

Restart `npm run dev` after changing `.env.local`, then visit
`http://localhost:3000/en/account/`.

## Deploy with the AWS CLI

After installing and configuring AWS CLI v2:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file infra/cognito-sandbox.yaml \
  --stack-name hushpdf-auth-sandbox \
  --parameter-overrides DomainPrefix=hushpdf-kryptonian23-sandbox \
  --no-fail-on-empty-changeset
```

Read the values for `.env.local` with:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name hushpdf-auth-sandbox \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[*].[OutputKey,OutputValue]' \
  --output table
```

## Staging hosting

`hosting-staging.yaml` creates a private, encrypted S3 bucket behind a
CloudFront distribution. The bucket blocks all public access; CloudFront uses
origin access control to read the static export. The response-headers policy
also supplies the cross-origin isolation headers required by the browser PDF
and LibreOffice engines.

Deploy the stack, build with its `SiteUrl` output as
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, and sync the export:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file infra/hosting-staging.yaml \
  --stack-name hushpdf-web-staging \
  --parameter-overrides EnvironmentName=staging

npm run build
aws s3 sync out/ s3://<BucketName output> --delete
aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id <DistributionId output> \
  --paths '/*'
```

Add `<SiteUrl>/en/account/` to the Cognito stack through
`AdditionalCallbackUrl` and `AdditionalLogoutUrl`. The billing stack's
`AllowedOrigin` parameter accepts a comma-separated list, so localhost and the
CloudFront staging origin can remain enabled together.

`deployment-role.yaml` is the least-privilege deployer used for staging. Its
bootstrap user can only assume the deployment role; routine deployments should
use the role rather than the AWS root identity.

The browser client deliberately has `GenerateSecret: false` and uses only the
OAuth authorization-code grant. Amplify supplies PKCE for the redirect flow.
The classic hosted UI is used for this sandbox so the user pool can remain on
the lowest applicable feature tier; branded managed login can be introduced
when the production domain is ready.

## Production identity

`cognito-production.yaml` is deliberately separate from the sandbox. It
retains the user pool on stack deletion or replacement, enables Cognito
deletion protection, offers authenticator-app MFA, and accepts explicit lists
of HTTPS callback and logout URLs. Include the localized `/account/` URL for
every language that can initiate sign-in.

Do not deploy the production stack until the permanent domain is controlled
and HTTPS is active. Production parameters and outputs belong in a protected
deployment environment; they must not be committed to this repository.
